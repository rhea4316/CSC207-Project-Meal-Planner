Toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper.\nSpread vegetables on a baking sheet and roast in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes until tender and slightly charred.\nWhile vegetables roast, heat a cast-iron skillet or grill pan over high heat until very hot.\nSear steaks for 4-5 minutes per side for medium-rare (adjust time based on desired doneness and steak thickness).\nAdd butter to the pan during the last minute of cooking and baste steaks with melted butter.\nRemove steaks from heat and let rest on a cutting board for 5-10 minutes (this allows juices to redistribute).\nSlice steaks against the grain into thick strips.\nServe steaks alongside roasted vegetables with lemon wedges on the side.",
